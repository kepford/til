> Today I Learned

A collection of short write-ups of things I learn from day to day.

*4 TILs and counting*

### Categories

* [Bash](#bash)
* [Vim](#vim)

### Bash

- [Expand Alias](bash/expand-alias.md)

### Vim

- [Sorting content in Vim](vim/sorting-content.md)
- [Delete all lines not containing a string](vim/delete-all-lines-containing.md)
- [Increment numbers on multiple lines in visual block mode](vim/increment-numbers-with-visual-block.md)

The `.vimrc` file for this project contains a function `CountTILs` that can
be invoked with `<leader>c`. This will do a substitution count of the
current number of TILs and display the result in the command tray.
